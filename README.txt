Wrapper (Not to be confused with Wrapper: Offline, Online, 2, or any other clones) is an WIP animation program written in C++.

Unlike previously, where the original Wrapper: Offline program ran in a HTML Flash environment, this program is fully rewritten and ported most Flash content to a more modern setup. This means that this will work on any computer without Flash, and all be ran by just siomply running the application.

The following list of things to do is the following:

- Build up the internal code for running at all (This project was just started)
- Add C++ dependencies (SDL2 for audio, FreeImage for image display, etc.)
- Port Flash assets to a format C++ understands (Biggie)
- Build a new video editor, combining both the LVM, the current Vyond video maker, and bringing in some other ideas I've had in mind. Such ideas I've had include:
    - Zooming in the timeline
    - More than 3-5 audio tracks (3 for music/sounds, 2 for talking)
    - Scene shortning going all the way down to 0.05
- XML parsing (For figuring out where backgrounds go), restructure how XMLs read backgrounds, props, and etc.
- Make a system to easily use themes, switch them, and even create them (For the end-user to go crazy on custom themes)
- And so much more...

This project will also be open source, to let others help out on making this project possible.
